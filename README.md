## ‚ú® Core Logic

*   üìà **Calculation of a score for a single activity** based on comparing the actual time with the "ideal" time of a hypothetical super-athlete.
*   ü•á **Calculation of the user's overall rating** based on the average of the 6 best results, which filters out unsuccessful or recovery workouts.
*   üèîÔ∏è **Automatic terrain classification** (flat, hills, mountains) for the correct application of difficulty coefficients.
*   üèÖ **Determination of performance level** (from 'Needs Improvement' to 'Elite') for a clear interpretation of the result.
*   üí° **Generation of personalized improvement tips** depending on the user's current level.

## üíª Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** Python
*   **Templating:** Jinja2
*   **Frontend (Template):** HTML5, CSS3
